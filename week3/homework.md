## Homework exercises for Week #3

The exercises this week wrap up the tasks in the Week 3 Jupyter notebook. For all the exercises, remember to comment your code.

### Mandatory
- Task 1: Clean the data (that is, follow these steps: 1) load the data, 2) identify nonsensical values, 3) remove/change any nonsensical values, 4) save your clean data set. Remember that missing values are fine - they just represent unknown bits of information). Make summaries and plots of the data (there are many options - just make a couple of summaries and a couple of plots. You can use the example code in the Jupyter notebook).
- Investigate if the participants in the sudoku experiment were faster doing the Latin letter or the Greek letter sudoku by taking the mean time for each type of sudoku (using your clean data set).

### Optional
- Task 3: solve Task 3 (again, there are many options - try out some of them).
